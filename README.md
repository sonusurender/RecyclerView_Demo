# RecyclerView
[RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.html) is more advanced and flexible and efficient version of ListView. RecyclerView ViewGroup is an container for larger data set of views that can be recycled and scrolled very efficiently. RecyclerView can be used for larger datasets to be rendered on the UI like a list. RecyclerView provides maximum flexibility to design different kind of views.

Just like ListView, RecyclerView is used to display a large amount of similar items on screen. But since the Android team was building an enhancement, they added a bunch of new features to RecyclerView. Each one of these new features, give a platform to developers for implementing a highly custom made RecyclerView. One of the custom implementations of RecyclerView is the new Gmail app on Android.
